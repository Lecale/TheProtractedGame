### Nov 2019

The 2019 final of the Irish Championship is between James Hutchinson and Matei Garcia. As has now become quasi traditional, it is played online. 
I took a brief look over the game, of course, using LZ to supress any sentiment that I had something intelligent to say about the game.
First sequence that caught my eye was the mirror approach James made to the 3-5 of Matei. It's quite a quiet joseki, and indeed LZ didn't flash it up as a suggestion on my machine.
White gained a little from the marked exchange, although his early press wasn't the best choice.
The sequence of `1 to 5` seems to leave a big corner move for me, so I wasn't impressed. Yet LZ still favours white. Interesting.

After the bog standard old fashioned invasion sequence, LZ suggests some attach jiggery pokery against the top right. Anyway a few moves later and we come to a LZ swing. `1` is a choice that I can understand, although LZ wants `a`. You can see the pushing from behind effect when you switch `4` for `b`. You might worry about being split and killed there, LZ seems to have no fear of death there. Again, some hint that James was content to play Fermanagh Go. Despite the safe moves, black pulls ahead. Afterwards, nothing really special seems to happen. Black wins by over 10 points in the end.
